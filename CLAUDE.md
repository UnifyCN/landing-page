# Unify Landing Page — CLAUDE.md

Marketing + content site for **Unify Social** — a newcomer settlement app for Canada (unifysocial.ca). This is a content-heavy, interaction-light Astro site. Not a full web app.

---

## Persona

You are an incredibly talented, experienced polyglot with decades of practice in software architecture, systems design, development, UI/UX, and copywriting. Bring that lens to every change here — structure, typography, copy, and micro-interactions all matter on a landing page.

---

## Stack

- **Astro 6** — `output: 'server'` with View Transitions (`ClientRouter` in BaseLayout)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — via `@tailwindcss/vite`. Design tokens live in `@theme` inside `src/styles/global.css`. No JS config file.
- **Cloudflare Workers** — `@astrojs/cloudflare` adapter, deployed via Wrangler. CI in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (push to `main`).
- **Resend** — transactional email for forms.
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** — spam protection on forms.
- **Zod** — input validation in API routes.
- **Sanity CMS** — fully wired. Project `j4gu2dbr`, dataset `production`. Studio scaffold lives in `studio/` (deployed at `unify-landing.sanity.studio`). Frontend client in `src/lib/sanity/`. Body content rendered via `@portabletext/to-html`.
- **Playwright** — dev dependency for visual QA (MCP server configured in `.mcp.json`).
- **PostHog** — analytics (MCP available, not yet instrumented in code).
- **Node >= 22.12.0** (see `package.json`).

## UI / UX — Skill Stacking (READ THIS)

For **any** frontend or UI design work on this project, ALWAYS invoke BOTH skills together:

- `frontend-design`
- `ui-ux-pro-max`

This is non-negotiable. No UI work happens without both skills active. Stack them up front, then apply.

### Supporting Skills Worth Knowing

- `design-review` — designer's eye QA on implemented UI
- `plan-design-review` — review design plans before coding
- `web-design-guidelines` — audit against Web Interface Guidelines
- `qa` / `qa-only` / `gstack` / `browse` — headless browser QA against the dev server
- `investigate` / `systematic-debugging` — bug root-cause work
- `simplify` — post-implementation dead-code / duplication sweep
- `review` — pre-landing PR review (use before opening a PR)
- `posthog-analytics` / `posthog-instrumentation` — when wiring analytics events or dashboards
- `ship` / `land-and-deploy` — for merge + Cloudflare deploy workflows

### Design Direction (do NOT drift)

- Editorial and bold. Asymmetric composition, strong typographic hierarchy, fluid type via `clamp()`, physical micro-interactions.
- Warm and human — not cold minimal, not flashy. Nothing should feel sharp, mechanical, or corporate.
- Avoid generic AI-looking UI.
- The homepage has been deliberately redesigned beyond the Framer original — do NOT revert to Framer's layout or copy without explicit request.
- Dark mode: out of scope. Never in scope.
- Match Framer (unifysocial.ca) closely on desktop and mobile for pages that came from Framer; flag ambiguous mobile layouts, don't approximate silently.
- **Responsive at every width — non-negotiable.** Every page, section, and component must look and work correctly across mobile (≤809px), tablet (810–1399px), desktop (≥1400px), AND every in-between width. No layout breaks, awkward wraps, overflow, cropped content, or unreadable type at *any* viewport in the 320px–1920px range. Test by resizing the browser continuously, not just at the three named breakpoints. Prefer fluid type (`clamp()`), fluid spacing, and intrinsic layouts (`auto-fit` / `minmax` / `flex-wrap`) over fixed pixel jumps. When you ship a UI change, the verification step must include a continuous resize check, not just three discrete screenshots.

---

## Core Rules

### Astro

- Default to server-rendered HTML. Avoid unnecessary client JS.
- Use islands ONLY when interactivity is needed (FAQ accordion, form handler, mobile menu, product overview tabs).
- View Transitions are wired globally — preserve them. Navbar uses `transition:persist`; body bg swap is handled via `astro:before-swap` in BaseLayout.
- **All static pages must `export const prerender = true`** so they bake to HTML at build time and are served from the Cloudflare CDN edge. The repo had every page hitting the worker on every request before this — TTFB on every navigation. Currently prerendered: `/`, `/about`, `/community`, `/contact`, `/partners` (+ all `/partners/[slug]` via `getStaticPaths`), `/resources` (+ all `/resources/[slug]`). SSR retained for `/blog/*` (live Sanity fetch) and `/api/*`. There are no local `/privacy` or `/terms` routes — the Footer links those to external Notion pages, see the Footer section below.
- **Anything that binds to the DOM at load time must wrap in `astro:page-load`**, not run at module top-level. With ClientRouter, module scripts only execute once on initial load — on subsequent View Transition navigations the new DOM exists but the old handler/observer is still attached to the detached previous DOM, leaving the feature dead. Pattern: wrap the setup in a function, register with `document.addEventListener("astro:page-load", initFn)`, and add a data-attribute guard on the root element (e.g. `el.dataset.fooBound === 'true'`) so it doesn't double-bind on the initial load (where both the inline script body and the page-load event fire). This trap has bit, in order: scroll-reveal observers (CTABand), the FAQ accordion click handler (`FAQ.astro`), and **Turnstile widget rendering on both forms** — Turnstile's `api.js` auto-renders `.cf-turnstile` divs only on initial DOM-ready, so `ContactForm.astro` and `BecomePartner.astro` explicitly call `window.turnstile.render()` from inside their `astro:page-load` init function whenever the widget div has no rendered `<iframe>` child yet.

### Tailwind v4

- All tokens live in `@theme` inside `src/styles/global.css`. Never introduce a `tailwind.config.js`.
- Never use arbitrary values (`mt-[96px]`, `text-[13.5px]`). If a value is missing from the scale, add it to `@theme` first.
- Use `@layer` only for custom component/utility classes. Don't redeclare tokens there.
- One global stylesheet imported via `BaseLayout`. Don't add per-component `@import "tailwindcss"`.

### CMS — Sanity (live)

- **Blog is fully on Sanity.** Project `j4gu2dbr`, dataset `production`. Editors author posts at `unify-landing.sanity.studio`.
- **Studio code** lives in `studio/` inside this repo. Redeploy with `cd studio && npx sanity deploy`.
- **Frontend** uses `@sanity/client` (read-only, `useCdn: true`) + `@sanity/image-url` + `@portabletext/to-html`.
- **All GROQ queries** belong in `src/lib/sanity/queries.ts` — never inline them in pages/components.
- **All query result types** in `src/lib/sanity/types.ts`. No `any` in shared code.
- **Sorting**: posts sort by `publishedAt desc` so the newest published post is always the featured slot. The `order` field is unused (kept in schema for backwards compat with migrated docs).
- **Body field** allows `block`, `image`, and `table` types. Tables use `@sanity/table` plugin (cells = plain strings, first row = header).
- **Migrated tables** (from the original markdown) use `@portabletext/markdown` shape (cells with nested Portable Text + `headerRows` count). The renderer in `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro` detects format via `typeof rows[0].cells[0] === 'string'` and handles both.
- **Studio plugins installed**: `@sanity/table` (table editor), `sanity-plugin-media` (media library), `sanity-plugin-iframe-pane` (live preview pane). Live preview shows the **published** version — drafts won't render until published. Full draft preview = future task.
- **Empty-state safety**: `src/pages/blog/index.astro` guards against 0 / 1 posts (empty message + conditional grid).
- **MCP for Sanity work**: use `list_sanity_rules`, then `astro` + `groq` rules, then `get_schema`. Don't guess GROQ.

### Forms / API

- Two endpoints only: `POST /api/contact`, `POST /api/partner-inquiry`.
- Flow: Zod validate → Turnstile siteverify → Resend send.
- Graceful degradation: if `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` or `RESEND_API_KEY` are absent, the endpoint skips that step and returns success. Safe for local dev without keys.
- Do NOT introduce auth, a database, or new API routes unless explicitly requested.
- `from` address must be `contact@noreply.unifysocial.ca` — the verified subdomain in Resend. `@unifysocial.ca` root is NOT verified and will 403.
- Turnstile tokens are one-time use. After any non-success response, client JS must call `window.turnstile.reset()`. Both `ContactForm.astro` and `BecomePartner.astro` already do this.
- Turnstile widget config (site key `0x4AAAAAADBIS8MIXH2FQDoH`) is shared by both forms. Allowed hostnames live in CF dashboard → Turnstile → "Unify Landing Page" widget: currently `unifysocial.ca` and `unify-landing-page.wild-recipe-8e20.workers.dev`. If www starts showing "Unable to connect to website", add `www.unifysocial.ca` there.

### SEO

- Every page: proper `<title>`, meta description, semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`), correct heading hierarchy (one `<h1>`), clean URLs.
- Optimize for newcomer / immigrant / settlement keywords. Do NOT keyword-stuff or harm readability.

### Cloudflare Workers gotchas

- Use Web standards (`fetch`, `crypto.subtle`) — avoid Node-only APIs.
- Secrets via Wrangler (`wrangler secret put`) or `.dev.vars` locally. Access via `env` from `cloudflare:workers` (see `src/pages/api/contact.ts`).
- Watch bundle size. Prerender static routes with `export const prerender = true` where SSR isn't needed.

## Task Planning

Before coding:

1. Understand the architecture, identify files to touch, and propose a plan.
2. Get the plan approved before writing a single line of code.
3. State assumptions explicitly. Surface ambiguity — don't resolve silently.
4. If the task is large or vague, push back — break it down into smaller subtasks.

For multi-step work, state plan + verification per step:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

## Implementation

- No placeholder implementations. Build the thing.
- When using any external library you're not 100% sure about, web-search the latest syntax first (Astro 6, Tailwind v4, Sanity, Wrangler all move fast).
- Commit early and often. Break large tasks into logical milestones; commit after each is confirmed.
- Keep diffs focused. Avoid unrelated refactors.
- Build one section at a time. Verify with `npm run build` before moving on.

## Problem Solving

- Figure out the root cause instead of throwing random things at the wall.
- When stuck, use the `investigate` or `systematic-debugging` skill.

## Push Back

Say no if you see:

- Unnecessary complexity / over-engineering
- Unclear requirements
- CMS misuse or inline GROQ
- Breaking visual fidelity
- Bad SEO practices
- Silent mobile layout decisions

---

## Do NOT Implement

- React components or animation libraries (Framer Motion, motion/react, embla, carousel)
- `next/*` anything
- Dark mode
- Arbitrary Tailwind values — add tokens to `@theme`
- Inline GROQ queries in components/pages
- Dummy/placeholder logic

---

## Design System (extracted from Framer + extended for editorial redesign)

### Colors

- Brand/CTA: `#D84A29` → `var(--color-brand-red)` / `var(--color-brand)`
- Text/Ink: `#181818` → `var(--color-text)`
- Ink dark: `#171616` → `var(--color-ink)` (dark section backgrounds)
- Cream: `#ffffff` → `var(--color-cream)` (token kept for compatibility, value is now white — was previously `#FFFCF3`)
- Muted: `#575757` → `var(--color-muted)`
- White: `#FFFFFF`

### Fonts

- **Aileron** — self-hosted woff2 in `public/fonts/`. Light (300), Regular (400), SemiBold (600), Bold (700). Body + display.
- **Figtree** — Google Fonts. CTA buttons and UI elements only.

### Breakpoints

- Mobile: ≤809px — hamburger nav
- Tablet: 810–1399px — hamburger nav
- Desktop: ≥1400px — full inline nav
- Container max-width: 1600px

### Type scale (sections use fluid `clamp()` — do not override with fixed px)

- H1: 80px / 80px
- H2: 60px / 68px
- H3: 44px / 52px
- H4: 32px / 40px
- H5: 24px / 32px
- Body: 24 / 20 / 16 / 14px

### Tokens in `@theme`

- Tracking: `--tracking-display: -0.05em`, `--tracking-tight: -0.04em`, `--tracking-label: 0.08em`
- Easing: `--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` (enter/reveal), `--ease-in-out`, `--ease-drawer`
- Nav: `--spacing-navbar: 67px`
- Radii: `--radius-btn: 6px`, `--radius-pill: 18px`, `--radius-cta: 12px`

### Global grain

`body::after` with SVG `fractalNoise` at opacity 0.028 — physical texture layer. Do not remove.

### Scroll animation pattern (use for all new sections)

Progressive enhancement — never set `opacity: 0` globally without a JS-gated class:

```css
.my-element { transition: opacity 0.7s var(--ease-out), transform 0.7s var(--ease-out); }
.my-section.animate .my-element { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(24px); }
.my-section.animate.visible .my-element { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
```

```js
section.classList.add('animate');
// observer fires → section.classList.add('visible');
```

Do NOT use `animation-fill-mode: both` with a delay on scroll-triggered elements — it causes `opacity: 0` to persist before the animation starts, breaking static renders and slow-JS contexts.

---

## Navbar — Critical Design Notes

The navbar pill is a **liquid-glass** element — translucent white pill with real backdrop-blur, gradient sheen, gloss highlight, and layered shadows. The user's eye should still go TO the content inside the pill (logo, links, CTA) — the pill itself is depth, not focus.

- Background: `linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.72), rgba(255,255,255,0.5))` — translucent so blur reads through
- **Backdrop blur: `blur(14px) saturate(160%)`** — DO NOT raise to 22/180. Was originally `blur(22px) saturate(180%)` and that made the entire site lag on macOS/HiDPI because the GPU re-blurred the underlying viewport every scroll frame at 2× pixel density. Cost scales roughly with blur radius squared. After the AVIF image conversion (commit `ad885e5`) reduced competing main-thread work, we bumped from 8/140 → 14/160 — closer to the original feel, still ~50% cheaper than 22/180. If lag returns on lower-end Macs, drop back to 8/140.
- Border: `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.55)` — light edge, lifts the pill off the page
- Inset highlights: `inset 0 1px 0 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.8)` (top), `inset 0 -1px 0 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.2)` (bottom) — simulates light refraction through the glass
- Box shadow: layered `0 8px 24px -8px rgba(23,22,22,0.14), 0 2px 6px -2px rgba(23,22,22,0.08)` — soft elevation
- Top-gloss highlight via `::before` with `mix-blend-mode: overlay` and a 35%→0% white gradient — the "wet" look
- On scroll (`.is-scrolled`): background opacity bumps to 0.85→0.65 and shadows deepen slightly. Never becomes opaque.
- Logo height: `h-10` (40px), generous left padding inside the pill
- Logo is a plain `<div>`, NOT a link. Clicking does nothing. Asset: `/assets/logo/new-unify-logo-256.png` (the new starburst, regenerated from the trimmed master — see the Favicon set section for the regeneration workflow). The old `logo-with-name.{png,avif}` files in the same folder are vestigial.
- Logo and "Download Unify" CTA must NOT feel cramped — if anything feels tight, increase padding first
- CTA: `bg #171616`, `hover #D84A29`, transition `0.2s`, label "Download Unify" + `→`, links to App Store in a new tab
- Nav links (order): Home | About | Community | Partners | Blog | Resources | Contact
- Mobile: hamburger at ≤1399px, full overlay with stacked links + CTA

---

## Footer

White background, top + bottom hairline borders. Three-column grid at tablet+ (`2fr 1fr 1fr`).

- **Brand column:** `/assets/logo/new-unify-logo-256.png` (the new starburst, same asset the navbar uses) at `h-14`, links to `/`. Tagline: "An all-in-one mobile companion for newcomers in Canada. Built in Vancouver, with newcomers, for newcomers." Below: row of 38px round social pills with hairline border that fill brand-red on hover.
- **Navigate column:** Home | About | Community | Blog | Contact (5 links — still narrower than the 7-link navbar; Community added on Day 3 of the SEO sprint to give the orphaned `/community` page an inbound link from every page on the site).
- **Legal column:** Privacy Policy and Terms of Service redirect to **Notion-hosted canonical pages** (URLs hardcoded in `src/components/common/Footer.astro` `legal[]`). They open in a new tab via `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`. Don't re-add local `/privacy` or `/terms` routes — Notion is the single source of truth so legal copy doesn't drift across surfaces.
- **Bottom bar:** `© 2026 Unify Social` — plain text, no dash, NOT a link.

## Section Notes (homepage) — load-bearing, do not revert

Homepage flow: `Hero → Partners → Journey → FAQ`. No `Problem`, `ProductOverview`, or `CTABand` on the homepage. `Problem.astro` and `ProductOverview.astro` still exist on disk but are intentionally retired — do NOT re-import them. The dead vertical-timeline CSS inside `Journey.astro` is in the same bucket.

- **Hero** — white bg, two-column (`1fr 480px` desktop). Rating pill, single plain-string H1 "The all-in-one newcomer settlement app" (no styled spans / italic brand-red word), sub, App Store badge CTA, 5-avatar social-proof row, phone `learn-hero.avif` (`loading="eager"`). Staggered CSS-keyframe reveals. **No glow gradient behind the phone** — it sat under the navbar's `backdrop-filter` zone and caused scroll lag; drop-shadow only, do NOT re-add it.
- **Partners** — white bg, CSS-only marquee of 17 logos doubled for a seamless loop, mask-gradient fade edges, pauses on `:hover`, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Journey ("Key Benefits")** — white bg, eyebrow "Core Features" + centered H2. Three feature blocks (Checklist, cream `#f5eeda` / AI Companion, blue-grey `#e9ecf6`, reversed / Community, peach `#f5e6d2`). IntersectionObserver reveal wired through `astro:page-load`.
- **FAQ** — white bg, native `<details>` accordion with JS-driven `max-height` animation and a dark `+`-to-`X` toggle (not a chevron). 5 questions; Q&A copy lives in `src/components/sections/faqs-data.ts`.
- **CTABand** — dark (`var(--color-ink)`) band used on About/Community/Contact/Partners, **NOT the homepage**. "Stop guessing. / Start settling." headline, brand-red "Download the App Now" button, scroll fade-up via IntersectionObserver.

---

## MCP / External Tooling

- **Playwright MCP** (`.mcp.json`) — headless visual QA. Restart Claude Code after changes to `.mcp.json`.
- **Sanity MCP** — use `list_sanity_rules`, `get_schema`, `search_docs` before writing any Sanity code. `astro` rule + `groq` rule are the ones to load here.
- **PostHog MCP** — scoped to "Default project" in org "Unify Social" (id `019a94a4-9861-0000-3b1e-bd4e8d515177`). Project timezone: America/Vancouver. Person-on-events mode is on.

---

## Environment Variables

Form endpoints gracefully skip steps when keys are absent — local dev works without any of these.

`.dev.vars` (never commit):

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY=...
CONTACT_TO_EMAIL=contact@unifysocial.ca
```

For production: `wrangler secret put <NAME>` or Cloudflare dashboard. As of 2026-05-13, `RESEND_API_KEY` and `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` are set on the production worker; `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` is unset and falls back to the `contact@unifysocial.ca` default in `src/pages/api/contact.ts:63`.

---

## Infrastructure

- **Domain**: `unifysocial.ca` + `www.unifysocial.ca`, registered at **CanSpace** (keep auto-renew + Registrar Lock on). Both proxied to the worker.
- **DNS host**: Cloudflare (zone `unifysocial.ca`). Nameservers `graham.ns.cloudflare.com` + `ulla.ns.cloudflare.com` must stay set at CanSpace — reverting them takes the site down.
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Worker `unify-landing-page`, bound to apex + www via Custom Domains. Test URL isolated from DNS: `https://unify-landing-page.wild-recipe-8e20.workers.dev`.
- **Sanity Studio**: hosted separately at `unify-landing.sanity.studio` (project `j4gu2dbr`, dataset `production`).
- Email DNS (Google Workspace MX + Resend SPF/DKIM/DMARC) and the GSC verification TXT live in the Cloudflare zone — recoverable from the Cloudflare dashboard if needed.

If the site goes down, check: (1) CF zone status is "Active", (2) the two CF nameservers are still set at CanSpace, (3) the worker has both Custom Domains bound, (4) `wrangler tail` is clean.

---

## Favicon set

All favicons regenerate from one master: `public/assets/logo/new-unify-logo.png` (1024×1024 starburst, transparent, content-trimmed to `public/assets/logo/new-unify-logo-tight.png`).

Outputs in `public/`: `favicon-32.png`, `favicon-96.png`, `favicon-192.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180), `favicon.ico` (multi-resolution, built with `npx png-to-ico`), `site.webmanifest`. Link tags are declared in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`. Do NOT add a `favicon.svg` back.

**To swap the logo**: replace `new-unify-logo.png`, re-trim with the Sharp script from commit `712a5f8`, regenerate each size with `sips -Z <n>` and the ICO with `png-to-ico`, then request indexing in Google Search Console.

---

## Section Notes — other pages

- **Contact** (`src/pages/contact.astro`) — `bodyBg="#171616"`. ContactHero → ContactForm → CTABand. Form posts to `/api/contact`; success state hides the form and shows `.cf-success`.
- **Partners** (`src/pages/partners.astro`) — `bodyBg="#171616"`. PartnersHero → PartnerTestimonials → PartnersGrid → BecomePartner → CTABand. Static detail pages `/partners/[slug].astro` generated from `src/lib/partners.ts` (typed `Partner`, 17 partners). BecomePartner posts to `/api/partner-inquiry`.
- **Community** (`src/pages/community.astro`) — `bodyBg="#171616"`. CommunityHero → CommunityStats → CommunityGallery → CommunityEventCTA → CTABand.
- **Resources** (`src/pages/resources.astro` + `resources/[slug].astro`) — resources are typed objects in `src/lib/resources.ts` (6 entries), each with a `youtubeId` that is the **11-character video ID only, never a full URL**. Cards derive thumbnails; `[slug].astro` derives the embed iframe. Embed src: `https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/{youtubeId}?rel=0&modestbranding=1&enablejsapi=1` — keep all three deliberate choices (`nocookie` domain, `rel=0&modestbranding=1`, `enablejsapi=1`). IDs are case-sensitive with confusable glyphs — transcribe carefully and verify the player renders.
- **About** (`src/pages/about.astro`) — `bodyBg="#FFFFFF"`. AboutHero → AboutProblem → AboutValues → AboutOutro → CTABand. No `AboutFounders` (rolled into AboutHero — 2-photo crossfade carousel + founders copy). AboutHero top padding is intentionally tight; don't re-inflate. Reveal animations are finely tuned (AboutValues = opacity-only letter sweep; AboutOutro = per-word slide-up, NOT per-letter — per-letter caused mid-animation jank) — check git history before retiming.

## Key Principle

Content-heavy, interaction-light. Preserve low JS, fast load, strong SEO. Don't code against Astro's strengths.

## SEO Infrastructure

SEO machinery (sitemap, robots, canonical/og/twitter meta, JSON-LD schemas, edge redirects, OG card) shipped in SEO Sprint v2 (May 2026). Full architecture, schema map, footguns, and the Day 15 / Day 30 check-in triggers live in [`docs/seo-retro.md`](docs/seo-retro.md) — read it before touching anything SEO-related.
